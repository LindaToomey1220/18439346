First you need to pull my project to make a local copy of it on your computer. 
Once this is done you will need to have Unity Hub Downloaded on your computer
Go onto Unity Hub and open the project by clicking the 'Add' button and navigating to where you saved the project.. 
Note: The name of the scene inside the project is 'MemoryPalaceScene'
